## Introduction

Text below is an amended/rewrite of the original README>md from
cloned repo --> https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1

"This assignment uses data from 
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on
the course web site:


* <b>Dataset</b>: <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">Electric power consumption</a> [20Mb]

* <b>Description</b>: Measurements of electric power consumption in
one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost
4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values
are available."


FILES:

There are 10 files listed for this project:

plot1.png -- plot generated from 'plot1.R' code

plot2.R -- R code to generate plot1.png

plot2.png -- plot generated from 'plot1.R' code

plot3.R -- R code to generate plot1.png

plot3.png -- plot generated from 'plot1.R' code

plot4.R -- R code to generate plot1.png

plot4.png -- plot generated from 'plot1.R' code

readSubsetData.R -- R code to read in a subset of the data from the larger dataset.
Subset data taken for two days only: 01 Feb and 02 Feb, 2007.

EXECUTION:

1.	Download the dataset to your PC (use the above links provided)

2.	Unzip the downloaded file to your current working directory

3.	Download the 'plotn.R' files to your current working directory

3.	Source the requisite 'plotn.R' 

4.	Run the function with the same name, 'plotn()', to create the related 'plotn.png' file
